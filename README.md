This is for REM 2019-2020 Conversion Technologies. Two days of Intro to solar radiation. R code and Notebooks provided for anyone who wants to play around with them.

If that doesn't work you can use Jupyter Notebook in a web browser or downloaded application to interact with the .ipnyb files, or download an R distribution to work with the code directly.
