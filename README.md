This is for REM 2019-2020 Conversion Technologies. Two days of Intro to solar radiation. R code and Notebooks provided for anyone who wants to play around with them.

1. Try the link below to open the folder in Binder:

   [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/RainerHilland/Teaching/master)
   
   Once the binder is initialised open the .ipnyb files to interact with the R code in the Jupyter Notebook format. Cells with R code can be executed by clicking inside the cell and pressing Shift+Enter (or Run at the top of the window). Opening the Binder creates a local copy of the code in your browser, so feel free to modify and play around with the code.

2. If that doesn't work you can use Jupyter Notebook with an R kernel through the desktop application, or use the .R code directly with an R distribution on your desktop.

These notebooks are used to illustrate certain concepts we discuss in the lectures. They are not homework and they will not be marked.
